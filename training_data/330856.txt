C[LovroS: Here I was expecting at leayt C4 or F4 or G3. I think G3 is a really big move, bcs W will than have two open corners and it will be really hard to deal with.

C[LovroS: kind of good exchange, black gets money, W a wall. But still not alive bcs of F8. (as seen later)

C[LovroS: This REALLY game me headache.... i had to go though sooo many variations! :)

C[LovroS: I figured this one was the best. I was expecting F2

;B[gf]
C[LovroS: actually I think H5 and trying to first minimize W 4group liberties would have been nice, but I did not see a way for B to make it work. I though you would build some nasty agi and than kill me.
LovroS: Sorry - i meant and then get the lower left corner.

C[LovroS: Here I was wondering Why I did not play D2. In retrospective I though it would have been better.

C[LovroS: I think with A2 I could have killed the hole bottom B group, but It would have been dificcult long and painful, also for W, since the middle is not really settled, also I was really eger to get F8, so I wanted Sente.

;B[ah]
C[LovroS: I could have respnded A3 which is sente against this corner group, bcs E1 kills in gote... but i though it's better to attack now.

;W[fb]
C[LovroS: I think that's it, afer B lost this corner...

C[LovroS: Did you play this move to connect under to the top left coner? But you live in the bottom...

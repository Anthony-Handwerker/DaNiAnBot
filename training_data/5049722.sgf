C[AkuDiSini: it's Indonesian
samuel_god: Oh I didn't assume you intended it. I'm just studying Japanese. 
AkuDiSini: Aku = I (I am), Di= in/at, Sini= Here
AkuDiSini: Aku di sini = I'm here
AkuDiSini: hahah
samuel_god: That's cool! I wish I knew more about indinesia(n)
AkuDiSini: ya
AkuDiSini: it's easy to learn indonesian
AkuDiSini: simple
samuel_god: Always seems cool but very out of the way, so it never seems like a good idea at this moment.
samuel_god: what language is it close to?
AkuDiSini: Malay
AkuDiSini: But It's not far from English
AkuDiSini: just different in Noun Clouse
AkuDiSini: Clause
samuel_god: That doesn't sound too bad. Anything would be a walk in the park after Japanese, lol

C[AkuDiSini: What does that mean?
AkuDiSini: What you mean?
AkuDiSini: do you like anime?
samuel_god: Japanese language is so hard. Harder than anything I've ever heard of. So after this, any other language will be easy. Anime is ok, I'm not a huge fan.
samuel_god: I've seen like 3 anime I think
AkuDiSini: Japanese is easy
samuel_god: Can you read it?
AkuDiSini: But the character is hard
AkuDiSini: Japanese in latin character is easy
samuel_god: What makes you think so?
AkuDiSini: I learnt a bit
AkuDiSini: just a lil bit

C[samuel_god: It's really not easy. Even in Latin characters. For one thing, unless you can read a language it's very hard to practice
AkuDiSini: hmmm
samuel_god: for another, it has the most complicated grammar of any commonly studied language.

C[samuel_god: I have to do some interviews soon in Keigo (polite language), which means mixing and matching special polite words, humble grammars for my own actions, normal polite grammar, etc. all in the same sentence.

AkuDiSini: so are you fluent in Japanese?

samuel_god: Japanese history, language and culture.
AkuDiSini: wew
AkuDiSini: cool
samuel_god: ありがとう
samuel_god: What do you do for a living?
AkuDiSini: and you just watched 3 anime?
AkuDiSini: I write
samuel_god: You're a writer? That's so damn cool
samuel_god: i respect that so hard
AkuDiSini: thanks
AkuDiSini: LOL
samuel_god: But yeah. Everyone expects me to be way into anime
AkuDiSini: hmmm
AkuDiSini: My name is Jihan.
samuel_god: Those people usually drop out after a year or two because the language is more brutal than fun.
AkuDiSini: hahah
samuel_god: My name is Samuel. Pleased to
AkuDiSini: hmmm
samuel_god: meer you, Jihan
AkuDiSini: :)
samuel_god: Meet*
samuel_god: sorry, on my phone.
AkuDiSini: nice to meet you too
AkuDiSini: I think Japanese is quite easy
AkuDiSini: but i dont know
AkuDiSini: I learnt in 4 weeks
samuel_god: Getting to the point where you can say hello and introduce yourself and ask for the bathroom is easy.
AkuDiSini: ya
AkuDiSini: Hwakhakha
samuel_god: But they have a lot of very subtle, important grammars to soften things and be roundabout.
AkuDiSini: I see
samuel_god: And it's rude to screw up
AkuDiSini: degree of politeness
AkuDiSini: My mother tongue is Javanese
samuel_god: What's that like? What's it close to?
AkuDiSini: Close to Sansekerta
samuel_god: Japanese also has random stuff like having to conjugate adjectives, frequently leaving the subject implied, 
AkuDiSini: hmmm
AkuDiSini: Are you still here?
samuel_god: "To" is a conditional that only means X follows Y naturally and automatically. "Tara" is a conditional meaning if X then Y, only with verbs. "Ba" is a conditional conjugation form that can be used with any part of speech, and only it can express hypotheticals/subjunctive. You can use it in place of "Tara," but there's no good rule when, and whenever you do, it's wrog
samuel_god: wrong*
samuel_god: yea, I'm here
samuel_god: Sansekarta=Sanskrit?
AkuDiSini: Hwahaaa, so complicated
AkuDiSini: ya Sanskrit
AkuDiSini: But javanese and indonesian are close
AkuDiSini: the grammar
samuel_god: Sanskrit is supposed to be divine. The Latin of Latin.
AkuDiSini: hmmm
samuel_god: Want to play again?
AkuDiSini: sure
AkuDiSini: who'll make the game?
samuel_god: One sec. I will

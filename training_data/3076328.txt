C[mark5000: Thanks
rasavatta: Thank you for the game 
rasavatta: Can you please tell me my mistakes 
mark5000: I was just going to ask you, can you identify what didn't work?
rasavatta: H6 was wrong 
rasavatta: I should have played h3
mark5000: H4, but yeah, I agree.
mark5000: That was where you started to fall behind.
rasavatta: Yes
mark5000: Have you seen the pattern where white takes influence like that?
mark5000: When you cut inside, usually white takes the outside marked spots. From move 9: 
rasavatta: Yesyes
mark5000: If you don't like that result, you can think about other choices.
mark5000: Namely H4
rasavatta: Ahh yes.
mark5000: Was there any other spot you thought you fell behind?
rasavatta: Move 5 c6 wasn't good enough i think 
mark5000: It's the right idea though
rasavatta: Oh okay 
mark5000: I would choose a different splitting move, but I would definitely split them.
mark5000: maybe simple. From move 4: D6 
rasavatta: Which move would you choose?? 
rasavatta: Yes it's much more secure 
mark5000: aggressive. From move 4: D7 
mark5000: Your move is one of my three choices.
mark5000: It's hard to say which is best.
mark5000: 15 and 17 were not great
mark5000: I think
mark5000: You should be killing the left stone, but you left me enough space to live.
rasavatta: I tink d7 would be in troubl... Can you please expand the variation fur. From move 4: D7 
rasavatta: Where do you think i should have played move 15
rasavatta: Now it's dead. From move 16: C4 B4 C3 B3 B2 B6 B7 
mark5000: probably simple again. From move 14: C5 
mark5000: attaching variation. From move 4: D7 D6 E6 F7 C4 C6 B4 
rasavatta: Now you live. From move 14: C5 B4 C4 B3 C3 B2 C2 B1 B6 A2 A5 
rasavatta: Ahh i see.. I concur 
mark5000: Black bends. Now both are in trouble. From move 14: C5 B4 F3 
rasavatta: Did you see " now you live variation"?? Is it correct?? 
mark5000: It's not right. Black gains more by bending at F3
rasavatta: I understand 
mark5000: White can't connect. From move 14: C5 B4 F3 E4 E3 D4 C4 C3 D3 
rasavatta: Yes..i get it 
mark5000: So it's not about killing one part or not. You have to do it in a way that makes you points
rasavatta: Yes, i understand

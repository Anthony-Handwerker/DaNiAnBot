C[herminator: Well, this turned into a points race very early. After only about 8 moves it was already clear both players would probably get half the board :)
herminator: I felt that D3 was slow. C7 is a very vital move, huge in terms of points swing. D3 puts no pressure on white, so he gets to play C7 first
herminator: I think E4 would have been better. If black can find a way to get sente and get to C7 first, the game looks good.
herminator: Getting hane on both sides. From move 8: E4 E5 D5 E3 D4 E6 H4 H5 H3 C7 H6 
herminator: Getting to C7 first. From move 8: E4 E5 D5 E3 D4 E6 H4 H5 H3 J5 C7 
herminator: THose are some possible variations. White should probably play a sharper move than E6 in those variations to keep the game close

C[herminator: After D3 and C7, I played to keep ahead while avoiding complications, but I do think B6 was slow again.
herminator: Hmmm, analyze mode stops working in the scoring phase, so I can't add variations. But I think B6 should be B7.

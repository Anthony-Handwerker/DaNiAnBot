C[The Almighty God: Thank you for the game!
noahthefuzzy: Thanks
noahthefuzzy: This was my favourite tourney
The Almighty God: We all start small
noahthefuzzy: Bye
The Almighty God: Thank you. Appreciate it. Sorry, i was not in chat for several minutes.Everybody, even on this platform has to start small, if he does not know which rank he is!
mouton: congrats
mouton: how come you're only 13k God?
mouton: You seem stronger, at least from what we could see today on 9x9
mouton: we definitely do, I am just saying your rank doesn't seem to reflect your actual strength
mouton: Anyway, congrats for the tournament, cheers

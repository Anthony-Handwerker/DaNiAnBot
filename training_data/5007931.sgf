samuel_god: Hi
AkuDiSini: that's not the way i learn, btw
AkuDiSini: we have our own way
AkuDiSini: that we enjoy
AkuDiSini: lol, no
AkuDiSini: i like reviewing, of course
samuel_god: Oh I know. I don't think you're wrong. Just, if you also liked reviewing, then we would make good reviewing buddies.
AkuDiSini: hmmm?
samuel_god: Because we're at a similar level of skill.
AkuDiSini: what you mean?
AkuDiSini: not like that
samuel_god: It doesn't matter. Let's have a good game :)
AkuDiSini: i like reviewing with all people
AkuDiSini: but this time is just for playing
samuel_god: Ah.
samuel_god: ok
samuel_god: go for it!
samuel_god: And enjoy

C[samuel_god: I'm also better at 19x19. But playing a lot of 9x9 made me improve at fighting.
AkuDiSini: i see
samuel_god: It used to be my weakest point, and I was terrible at 9x9. So I focused on it and now I feel like I'm ok.

C[amsone: thanks for the game, well played
]
;W[ch]
C[smeghead: Thank you as well, but I think it's not over yet!
amsone: really?! well, let's see

;B[ci]
C[amsone: I think you can make a ko, but then it'll be a furikawari with the top... but maybe I'm misreading
]
;W[ei]
C[smeghead: I don't think it's a ko, just a capturing race?

C[amsone: well, uh, duh, how did I not see that
smeghead: D:
smeghead: fwiw w was ahead anyway
amsone: oh definitely
smeghead: but yeah, i guess b had to protect so one less moku
smeghead: thanks for the gaem
amsone: thanks, you too
amsone: I think B 29 is the losing move, seems way slow and then W gets much stronger on the right
smeghead: B 29?
amsone: C8
amsone: should have been like G3
smeghead: I think it was too late then, though. I don't think the cut worked if that was what you were thinking?
smeghead: ah
smeghead: yeah possibly
smeghead: seems a lot bigger
amsone: :)
amsone: well, thanks again for the game; hope we play again sometime
smeghead: Thank you as well.

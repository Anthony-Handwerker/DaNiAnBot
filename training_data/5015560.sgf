Enumaris: I don't have enough points
spatula: Onrable said you win so you win lol
spatula: what's the strongest bot called?
Enumaris: how can that be, white has 9 on left I have 11 on top w+2.5
Enumaris: unless you're seeing a seki on the left or something I don't see how you can count it that way
spatula: ...billy is not accepting my game..
Enumaris: oh
Enumaris: does white have to fix stuff on the left
Enumaris: whoops
Enumaris: oh well
Enumaris: w+.5 still. From move 52: H5 J6 J7 J4 D9 B5 A9 
Enumaris: either way I'm lost
Enumaris: oh wellI misread the bottom left
Enumaris: fail
Enumaris: bottom right*
spatula: ....I'm so confused
spatula: I mean.. where did B+5.5 come from?
spatula: bot didn't accept lol
spatula: ... right side .. I didn't read it out..
spatula: cuz there's no other way out lol
spatula: so I just play what I have to play ...
Enumaris: I missed the j3 move
spatula: yup
spatula: i saw that..
Enumaris: at that point I knew I lost
Enumaris: so I wasn't really
Enumaris: paying attention anymore
Enumaris: yeah
Enumaris: that's better
Enumaris: oh well
Enumaris: gg spoon
spatula: gg...
spatula: ... I just got lucky in this game
spatula: didn't read ahead
spatula: so.. I should play something else after this move. From move 7: 
spatula: possible?. From move 9: F2 D3 C2 E1 F4 E4 F5 F6 G6 
spatula: nvm. From move 9: F2 D3 C2 D1 F4 F3 G4 G2 
spatula: ugh not that
spatula: hmm. From move 9: F2 D3 C2 D1 F4 G4 F3 E4 F5 F6 
spatula: lol yep

spatula: alive?. From move 9: F2 D3 C2 D1 F4 G4 F3 E4 F5 F6 G6 H6 G7 H7 H2 H4 H3 
spatula: looks alive
spatula: oh god..
spatula: so difficult
spatula: I was concered
spatula: if it could live
spatula: I see..
spatula: you know
spatula: I was thinking about the exact same thing
spatula: during the game
spatula: and i thought...
spatula: playing on the top would damage my bottom group lol
spatula: i chose to play bottom..
spatula: cuz I have option to threaten to link up
spatula: ,,, so I thought I could let black get less.. influence?
spatula: "influence'
spatula: gotta get dinner now
spatula: bye Ornable
Enumaris: I need to work on my reading a lot 
spatula: and thanks for the game Enu..
Enumaris: thanks for the game
spatula: my reading isn't solid..
spatula: I also very slow
Enumaris: outread me in this game :D
Enumaris: I lose so many games just to to straight getting outread
Enumaris: think I killed a dragon
Enumaris: and then find out I didn't
Enumaris: stuff like that
Enumaris: even the 12k's outread me in situations like that -.-
Enumaris: so frustrating ._.
spatula: this game.. is just me getting lucky.. in some game i read very far.. for this ugh there's just not that many option for me..
spatula: I just try to ugh.. extend my life
spatula: Enu your just have to be patient I guess..in terms of reading
spatula: why?
Enumaris: I keep mising moves
spatula: same....
Enumaris: I read up to H2 when I played D2 and thought I just won
spatula: I miss ataris
spatula: I mean shortage of liberty
spatula: I can't really see that when I read..
spatula: so.. often take me a long time to do tsumego that involve golden chicken
Enumaris: I see all the basic tesuji easily but then don't confirm that they actually work
Enumaris: cus I'm stupid
spatula: Enu.. don't be sad
spatula: I mean.. you need to let me win some games
spatula: else or hyakubango...
spatula: is gonna end prematurely lol
Enumaris: I don't mind losing, it's more I mind that I keep misreading basic stuff
Enumaris: cus I'm dumb
spatula: ugh... it's gonna take a while for me to catch up...
Enumaris: it's a misread if I thought it was dead and I didn't bother to go down that road
Enumaris: but I guess I would also mind if I somehow lost just due to a slow grind hmm
Enumaris: I guess I'm just a really sore loser
Enumaris: lol
spatula: I mean..
spatula: I feel the same
spatula: after losing to you
spatula: in some games
spatula: or losing in general..
spatula: I feel quite bitter
spatula: after losing to a  12k
spatula: and..
spatula: he message me yesterday.. I ignored him lol
spatula: .. I should probably reply now..
Enumaris: sadly I don't feel better when I win 99% of the time
Enumaris: cus I still see my erros and feel stupid
spatula: Enumaris
spatula: play more ranked games
spatula: it feels quite different.. winning ranked games and unranked game
spatula: ... but I only play ranked games
Enumaris: people will call me sandbagger again when I lose a bunch and drop back to 10k or something
spatula: when I feel like I can rank up
spatula: during game?
spatula: or..irl?
spatula: oh.. would you get  extra nervous during kofight
spatula: I just totally avoid playing ko.. unless I'm sure I'm losing
spatula: or when I have a bunch of ko fight
spatula: I see
spatula: more like.. hating myself
spatula: for 
spatula: not taking opponent serious enough 
spatula: and
spatula: ... will there's different type of frustrations
spatula: I will give you a list later..
spatula: I'm really hungry now
spatula: gotta get dinner..

Ornable: GUYS PLEASE
Ornable: black+1.5 bro

Ornable: make that black+5.5
Ornable: ok
Ornable: so do
Ornable: you want real counting?
Ornable: white wins by .5
Ornable: final count
Ornable: that's what i said
Ornable: XD
Ornable: gg
Ornable: look at enu's variation
Ornable: that's final position

Ornable: >.>
Ornable: lol
Ornable: d1. From move 48: B5 B7 B4 
Ornable: d2. From move 26: H4 
Ornable: tengen is difficult to play against on 9x9
Ornable: d3. From move 5: G7 
Ornable: this is sort of joseki move. From move 1: E7 E3 
Ornable: seems difficult
Ornable: hard fight. From move 9: F2 D3 C2 D1 F4 E4 F5 F6 G6 H6 G7 G4 F3 H7 
Ornable: lol that's basically same as my variation

Ornable: another difficult fight. From move 9: F2 D3 C2 D1 F4 G4 F3 E4 F5 F6 G6 H6 G7 H7 H2 B4 C4 B6 
Ornable: but i think black might get enough points here?. From move 9: F2 D3 C2 D1 F4 G4 F3 E4 F5 F6 G6 H6 G7 H7 H2 B4 C4 C7 
Ornable: you want to play here so you don't damage your corner lol. From move 5: G7 
Ornable: ya
Ornable: if you play like this
Ornable: black has a harder time leaning on your group
Ornable: so he can't damage the other
Ornable: if you play g3 then one group will be damaged
Ornable: XD
Ornable: D:
Ornable: sounds like you guys need to play a game of chess
Ornable: because if you play chess you'll be distracted by your terrible moves there

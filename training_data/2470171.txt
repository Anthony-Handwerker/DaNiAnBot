C[Terranigma: preventing the cut with h2 is larger than doing so with h5. From move 8: H2 
Ingrid: Oh, thanks for the idea -- I hadn't thought of that way of taking care of the situation, but it makes complete sense -- thank you for pointing it out!

C[Ingrid: Thank you for the game!  I've been thinking a lot about b8 -- was there any hope of anything for black?  (At one point, I thought black may be able to get a seki or some horrible ko...not that that would have been enough, of course!)
Terranigma: A ko seems unavoidable to me, but in this case it would have been a ko I could not win.
Terranigma: Start with D9. From move 28: D9 
Terranigma: White cannot respond by connecting at B9. From move 28: D9 B9 B7 A5 A6 A8 A4 F9 A7 E9 A9 B9 B8 
Terranigma: So White has to play A9, and then black plays the ko.. From move 28: D9 A9 B9 
Terranigma: Now white needs a ko threat, but in this game there were none of those for me.
Terranigma: Moreover, white cannot respond to B9 by connecting at A8 either.. From move 28: D9 A9 B9 A8 A7 C9 B7 
Terranigma: In this game I played a bad (too small, too soon) move at F3, and I was very much losing the game.
Terranigma: So B8 was me "trying" something, knowing it didn't really work... but that the correct response would be surprisingly complicated. :)
Terranigma: So, good game, in any case!

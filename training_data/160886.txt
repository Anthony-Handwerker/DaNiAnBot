C[stonedaze: Contact play like this builds up strength for me to act on the two stones behind me.In exchange, you get to reinforce corner if you like.

C[stonedaze: I'm NOT saying playing elsewhere is wrong,especially on remaining corner. Bear in mind though that if you DO tenuki(play elsewhere) to a contact play, you're then outnumbered 2 to 1 locally. So it is unusual.

C[stonedaze: I have to get into the moyo(area) you are building up.

C[stonedaze: Remember comment on move 1? If you want to attack a stone, paradoxically best NOT to make contact as I can push back against you and gain strength and life. Paradoxes like this make Go hard sometimes!

C[stonedaze: Now you stamped out resistance of edge stone, but I exchanged it for grabbing a 2nd corner, so quite happy.Always consider sacrificing 1 or 2 weak stones rather than trying to keep everything alive.

C[stonedaze: This side-contact move(yoko tsuke) can only gain you 1-2 points in centre and gives me excuse to further strengthen my edge. No way to separate me, so best play elsewhere in open top area.

C[stonedaze: Notice that I got into this plum, biggest open edge area first...big advantage to be in first.

C[stonedaze: Above all, cut out moves like this..an empty triangle.As I said at the time, if you play H4 instead, you win!

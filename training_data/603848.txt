C[SnowCrystal: if you enable the analsysi I will win this game
superway: why?
superway: I am new here, never used analysis before
SnowCrystal: cos I would have calculated the C5
SnowCrystal: when I was doing it in my head
SnowCrystal: I thought there is no problem for u to go C5
SnowCrystal: if you simply enable analsysi
SnowCrystal: I would saw it
superway: c5 is a simple mistake
SnowCrystal: well if you enable analysis I can see it
SnowCrystal: I just don't understand why ppl disable analysis
superway: it is always tricky in these places
SnowCrystal: plz enable analsysis in your future games if you want to have good game
superway: I took a couple munites to think through

C[maskerfreedomlittlemonster: thanks
aik: ugh.. by 10 pts
aik: thanks :)
maskerfreedomlittlemonster: it's because of komi
maskerfreedomlittlemonster: you are a strong 9k
aik: hm.. right, the diff is 5 pts
aik: one day i managed to capture the entire board in a game against a 6 kyu, in another game i lost almost everything to a 18 kyu - it depends :)
maskerfreedomlittlemonster: haha yeah :)
maskerfreedomlittlemonster: maybe it was a fake 18k tho :P
aik: it's possible; there is one 18k here that consistently beats me :)
aik: does this make sense?. From move 22: G6 
aik: i though about making something fancy, but decided not to risk
maskerfreedomlittlemonster: yeah that would be a good move
maskerfreedomlittlemonster: d1. From move 24: G6 H6 F7 H8 D9 F9 B8 
maskerfreedomlittlemonster: i was assuming your moves like this
aik: hm.. theres something wrong with the way the site displays the variation.. let me reload the page..
aik: now it's better; however as white i would reply in a different way
aik: like this. From move 22: G6 F6 F7 E8 
maskerfreedomlittlemonster: hmm
aik: here black attempts to take the cutting stone. From move 22: G6 F6 F7 E8 F5 D7 E6 D6 D5 C5 
aik: and gets two hardly alive groups
aik: anyway... one more? and then it seems i have to go to sleep :)

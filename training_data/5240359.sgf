C[samuel_god: They have a couple strenghts. For one thing, look at the size and natural rescources of US, china, india, the closest economies
]
;W[]
C[samuel_god: Despite all these things, Japan, as a 0 rescources island, is still the third largest GDP in the world.
monster1: true
samuel_god: They have invested more in human capital than just about anyone, which positions them great for the 21st century
samuel_god: Their production is all in service, robotics, nanotechnology, that kind of thing.
monster1: how are they per capita
]
;B[]
C[samuel_god: Decent. Not socialists, better than america.
monster1: better than Germany?
samuel_god: 99.9%+ literacy rate
samuel_god: I'm not sure vs germany.
monster1: I'm 50
samuel_god: My theory for their population issue is that they'll start letting women work.
samuel_god: Women rarely work
monster1: and my age probably makes me have a bias
monster1: in the 1980's
monster1: there was a lot of propaganda about them taking over the world
monster1: women not working ... that's huge
samuel_god: And I think as labor declines, they won't want to let in foregin workers, so they will integrate women into the workplace, and that will fix a lot of gender issues.
monster1: big untapped labor force
samuel_god: Yes
monster1: interesting
samuel_god: That's why I'm not terrfied of them running out of workers
monster1: that is very promissing
samuel_god: And it would be great for the ir society to get women working, socially
samuel_god: Biggest issue is population declline, but I don't think they need a huge population.
monster1: yes ... that is very good news for japan
monster1: population isn't a numbers problem
monster1: it's a distribution problem
monster1: ratio of retired people
samuel_god: Distribution will be fine. They already have started having robots care for the elderly
monster1: lol
monster1: too expensive
monster1: too limited
samuel_god: Regardless, put it this way. China is supposed to be taking over the world right now
samuel_god: Except things look pretty shaky
monster1: that's bullshit
samuel_god: That's because most of the other "take over the world" countries have terrible foundations
samuel_god: No investment in human capital
samuel_god: Economic lies
monster1: China has big problems
samuel_god: Pollution
samuel_god: All kinds of issues.
monster1: huge issues
monster1: corruptioin
monster1: social ills
samuel_god: Japan had its bubble of explosive growth, and that ended, but they're still positioned to be one of the greates powers in the world for a long time to come.
monster1: political problems
samuel_god: Japan is like the opposite of china. No more explosive growth, but all the fundamentals are right, pretty much.
monster1: I guess if you say that Japan will be a top economic power ... I have to agree
samuel_god: And possibly IR/Millitary, the way things are heading.
monster1: IR?
samuel_god: international relations
samuel_god: They're remilitarizin
samuel_god: g
samuel_god: And even before they were, the "national self defense force" was twice the size of russia's army
monster1: who is more productive ... japan or S korea?
samuel_god: Japan, by far
samuel_god: Productive=GDP?
monster1: per capata?
monster1: yes ... GDP per person
monster1: I tend to group Taiwan / S korea / Singapore and Japan together in a per capata basis
samuel_god: Google says still japan
samuel_god: By a lot
monster1: hummm
samuel_god: https://www.google.co.jp/search?q=gdp+per+capita+south+korea&oq=gdp+per+capita+south+korea&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.4053j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
samuel_god: https://www.google.co.jp/search?q=gdp+per+capita+japan&oq=gdp+per+capita+japan&aqs=chrome.0.0l6.3257j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
monster1: I wonder if the difference has to do with currency differences
monster1: .
monster1: for example
monster1: France's GDP per person
monster1: is higher than Japan
monster1: .... they're not that productive
monster1: lol
samuel_god: Lol
monster1: want to hear something interesting
samuel_god: Sure
monster1: if a country is run primarily by Protestants
monster1: ... it's a very rich country
monster1: even cheezy New Zealand
samuel_god: Too many conflating variables to be meaningful though
monster1: really?
samuel_god: Yeah, probably
monster1: different climates
monster1: ... it's not climate
monster1: different natural resources
monster1: very different
monster1: .... it's cultural
monster1: anglo and catholic .... pretty rich country
samuel_god: I could probably list like 3 other possible explanations off the top of my head
monster1: name a couple
monster1: ... name one
samuel_god: Protestants are mostly white, countries run by white people are much richer
monster1: is russia protestant?
samuel_god: Protestant countries on average are vastly more secular, which is a strong correlate to wealth, though causation probably runs the other way.
samuel_god: No, orthodox.
monster1: former soviet countires protestant?
samuel_god: No
monster1: catholic?
samuel_god: no
monster1: what is a country like Bulgaria?
samuel_god: Orthodox christian
monster1: they're white ...
samuel_god: Yes
monster1: and not that rich ...
samuel_god: But on average, white countries are much richer
monster1: second world ...
monster1: sure
monster1: but compare white and not protestant and white and protestant
monster1: I think France is the richest catholic country
monster1: and 1/2 of germany is catholic
monster1: like japan .... the success is in the people
monster1: it's not natural resources
monster1: it's the culture
samuel_god: How many countries would you describe as protestant?\\
monster1: you mean a count?
monster1: I don't know  ... I guess 30?
samuel_god: How many of those are protestant because they were colonized by england, by far the nicest of the colonizers?
monster1: not true ...
monster1: Norway
monster1: RICH
monster1: Denmark
monster1: RICH
monster1: Swiss ... rich
monster1: Flemish ... rich
monster1: etc
samuel_god: Protestant countries are basically northern europe and their colonies
monster1: yes ... correct
monster1: but ... you have to agree there is something in the culture
monster1: Protestants ... Japanese ... Jews
monster1: winning cultures
samuel_god: I just think that it is unquestionable that those countries are doing really well, but that there are a million possible factors, and that literally hundreds of thousands of pages of theories exist as to why europe did so well.
monster1: I'm an electrical engineer
monster1: this isn't my specialty
monster1: I'm just saying it's cultural
monster1: powers of WW2 ... USA  Germany ... Japan
monster1: major powers today
monster1: ... it's the people
samuel_god: Right, but at the simplest you could say: cultural factors in these countries made them both succesful and likely to adopt protestantism.
samuel_god: I'm just saying that the cause-effect chain is really hard to establish
monster1: I agree 100%
monster1: 100
monster1: if we were to get a shit counry
monster1: like Sierra Lionne
monster1: and convert them into protestants
monster1: they'd still be crap
samuel_god: At the end of the day, I agree with you that cultural factors trump a lot of other stuff and are hugely important
samuel_god: I just find it very hard to isolate one specific cultural factor
samuel_god: But winning cultures exist
samuel_god: At least situationally
monster1: what's funny about the USA
monster1: is that
monster1: except for high fashion
monster1: it dominates in every industry
monster1: question ... does Japan have any big pharma companies?
samuel_god: A lot of that is because we have a total monopoly on global education and knowledge production
monster1: we've invented practically everything
samuel_god: Yeah
samuel_god: But
samuel_god: That's not really cultural
samuel_god: At least not now
monster1: sure it is
samuel_god: Right now?
monster1: yes
monster1: absolutely
samuel_god: Do you know how much more money we throw at universties vs everyone else?
monster1: we take chances
samuel_god: Of the top 300 universties in the world, I'd bet more than 275 are american. MOstly due to funding. They take a ton of foreigners, but our government funds this.
monster1: we charge foreign students a lot
monster1: and
monster1: we get a great return on them as well
monster1: they usually stay here
samuel_god: Yeah
samuel_god: But
monster1: they create companies
samuel_god: Right now, american knowledge production is mostly because we have a ton of wealth, we throw a ton of wealth at universities
monster1: we have a bipolar education system
monster1: rich kids get a great education
monster1: poor kids get crap
samuel_god: I mean univesity level
monster1: we have great universities!
monster1: if I had to bet on a country ... I'd bet on USA
samuel_god: Me too
monster1: who would you bet for number 2?
monster1: I think Germany
samuel_god: That's pretty tough
samuel_god: I think China, even with all its problems
monster1: per capata?
samuel_god: Taking the long historical view, they've been the most powerful, productive and inventive country for most of world history.
samuel_god: THey have enormous populations
samuel_god: Even with a lot of issues, they're one of the most powerful and succesful countires around.
monster1: but it's based on it's size ... no?
samuel_god: I would never want to live there because I hate the culture.
samuel_god: No, not just size
samuel_god: Organizational ability
monster1: I hate the culture too
samuel_god: They have a LOT going for them
monster1: yes .. they have good management
monster1: they work hard
monster1: but they are currupt
samuel_god: I just think they have been pretty much the strongest country on average for like 3000 years
samuel_god: So they're a safe bet
monster1: I wouldn't bet on them on a per capata basis
samuel_god: God no
samuel_god: BUt
samuel_god: The per-capita evaluation isn't what they care about
samuel_god: And there's no good reason for them to
samuel_god: They're not a democracy
monster1: how else to compare?
samuel_god: THeir greatness is not built on the happiness of the average peasant.
monster1: they have no feeling for the individual
samuel_god: Yes. But I think they will outlast america
monster1: did you ever see the video of the child being run over
samuel_god: No. I don't want to.
monster1: body on the ground ... people walking by and doing nothing
samuel_god: I hate chinese culture, but it's pretty succesful
monster1: I hate them too
monster1: what I like about Japanese is that they are honor bound
samuel_god: mm
monster1: how are the koreans different from the japanese
monster1: I'm white in California ... I kinda bunch them together as being similar
samuel_god: Koreans didn't have a civilization historicallly
monster1: hmmm
samuel_god: They were totally lapdogs of the chinese, because of proximity
samuel_god: Then of the americans
monster1: hmmm
samuel_god: Whereas the Japanese were very, very isolated
samuel_god: One of the most unique cultures around
monster1: I see
samuel_god: Koreans are the italians of asia
monster1: the oceans protected them
samuel_god: Japanese are like the british/germans
samuel_god: Oceans, and the sea of japan is terrible to cross
monster1: huh
monster1: rough waters?
samuel_god: Ever hear about what happened to Kublai Khan?
monster1: no ... sorry ... I'm a tech guy
samuel_god: After the mongols conquered all of asia and eastern europe, they heard that japan had a lot of natural rescources (false) and told them to surrender
samuel_god: The japanese ignored it
monster1: japan natural resources ... funny
samuel_god: So
samuel_god: The mongol king of china builds the biggest fleet the world has ever seen
samuel_god: Sails it to japan
samuel_god: All die in a typhoon.
samuel_god: So
samuel_god: He tries again, a few years later
samuel_god: Biggest fleet till WWI
samuel_god: All die in a typhoon
monster1: wow
monster1: what year?
samuel_god: I forget
samuel_god: But
samuel_god: Yuan dynasty
monster1: 1400's?
samuel_god: Yeah
samuel_god: Anyway, that was the start of Kamikaze
samuel_god: it means divine wind protecting japan
samuel_god: They had good reason to thinkk the gods made their country invincible
samuel_god: After that
monster1: huh
monster1: intesesting
monster1: did you study WW2?
samuel_god: Literally every country they knew about fell to the mongols
samuel_god: Not them
samuel_god: I studied some
samuel_god: Mostly japan side
monster1: interesting naval battles in the Phiilipeans
monster1: main japanese naval officer didn't want to bomb pearl harbor
samuel_god: They should never have fought us
monster1: yeah
samuel_god: We made them, basically
monster1: lol
monster1: we re made them
monster1: getting late here
monster1: going to bed
monster1: cheers
monster1: bye
samuel_god: Cheers
